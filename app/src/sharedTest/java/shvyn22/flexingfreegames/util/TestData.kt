The game features both a multi-player and single-player mode with adventures, skirmishes and a player vs. AI mode. All of this is developed by the same team behind The Witcher III: Wild Hunt.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the core game is based on the card game featured in Wild Hunt, but with several new additions. The stand alone card game features new card art, voice overs and skills. There is even a competitive PvP mode built completely from scratch for Gwent.\r\n\r\nAs with any card game, players will be able to choose a deck type (or faction), build it out, and go into battle against other players. Gwent features a gameboard with a battlefield built of three rows, melee, ranged, and siege. Each row can be populated with cards of varying stats. A game is won when a player takes two out of three rounds.",
